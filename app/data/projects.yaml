- name: Swarachakra
  date: April 2014 - May 2014
  extra_classes: tall
  description: |
    Swarachakra is a keyboard designed for Indic languages. The letters of the Indic languges are different from Latin scripts as 2 or more of the unicodes combine to form various complex letters. So the standard qwerty keyboard layout is ineffective. So a novel keyboard layout with a different interaction model was developed.

    The app extends a `InputMethodService` to provide a new keyboard. It's available in 12 Indic languages on Playstore. The capability to have build flavors is leveraged as the keyboard for each langugage has changes that are more that just string localisations
