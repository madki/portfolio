title: Developer Portfolio
subtitle: "Madhu kiran (@madki)"
intro: |
    I am primarily a mobile developer who happens to have worked with a few web and backend projects. I was the co-founder of [Workarounds](http://workarounds.in) and before that I worked with [IDC, IIT Bombay](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/) on a few interesting projects. I have majorly worked as a freelance developer working remotely through most of my career

    I've relocated to US recently and am looking for interesting projects to work on.
