subtitle: "Madhu kiran (@madki)"
intro: |
    I am primarily an Android developer who happens to have worked with a few web and backend projects. I was the co-founder of [Workarounds](http://workarounds.in) and before that I worked with [IDC, IIT Bombay](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/) on a few interesting projects. I was working with [Headout](http://www.headout.com) in the role of android and java backend developer for the past year.

    Currently playing with a few ideas for mobile games.
